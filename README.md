# Spongebob Unity Game with AI

Welcome to the Spongebob Unity Game with AI! This game is built using Unity and features an AI-controlled Spongebob who is trying to catch Plankton while he collects burgers. In this game, you play as Plankton, and your goal is to collect a certain number of burgers to complete each level, while avoiding Spongebob. Each level requires you to collect an increasing number of burgers, up to a maximum of 9 burgers for level 5. If you successfully complete level 5, you win the game. However, if Spongebob catches you before you complete level 5, you lose the game. You can restart the game at any time.

## AI Implementation

The AI for Spongebob was implemented using Unity's Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) toolkit. The AI agent was trained using reinforcement learning, which allowed it to learn how to catch Plankton while avoiding obstacles and collecting power-ups. The AI's behavior is influenced by a set of reward signals, which are assigned based on its performance in the game. The AI also uses a neural network to make decisions about its actions.

## Getting Started

To play the Spongebob Unity Game with AI, you will need to download or clone the repository from GitHub using the following link:

https://github.com/engyahmed7/Spongebob-Unity-Game

Once you have downloaded the repository, you can open the project in Unity and run the game from the editor. Alternatively, you can build the game and run it on your computer.

## How to Play

To control Plankton, use the arrow keys on your keyboard. Use the left and right arrow keys to move Plankton left and right, respectively. 
To collect burgers, simply touch them with Plankton.

You must collect a certain number of burgers to complete each level. The number of burgers required for each level is as follows:

- Level 1: 5 burgers
- Level 2: 6 burgers
- Level 3: 7 burgers
- Level 4: 8 burgers
- Level 5: 9 burgers

If you successfully collect the required number of burgers for a level, you will automatically proceed to the next level. If Spongebob catches you before you complete level 5, you will lose the game and have to restart from the beginning.
